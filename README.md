### Welcome Message
___
Welcome to Group 3's OODP Project. This project allowed our team to venture beyond the syllabus of this course to gain insightful skills and knowledge by applying what we learnt over the semester. 

We would also like to thank our Teaching Assistant Xu Shifeng for teaching us what to take note and look out for over the semester during our lab sessions.
